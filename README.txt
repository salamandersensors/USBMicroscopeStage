Inverted microscope stage by CKH at Univ of Louisville for USB scope from Adafruit (http://adafruit.com/products/636)

There are 3 files for laser cutting: sides (laid out with two identical pieces), top (cut 1, or 2 if you want it to have a solid base) and back (cut one piece, there's a hole you can thread the USB connector through) 

The back and sides are 5 inches across, cut from 1/4 inch thick clear acrylic, the top is 1/16â€³ (thin so you can still focus 200x on your items) and the nuts and bolts are 6-32 nylon. We had some Mcmaster nylon parts already: 94812A113 (nuts) and 94609A153 (bolts, were a bit long but easy to cut to length)
